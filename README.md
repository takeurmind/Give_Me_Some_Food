Development of improved calculation module(GMSF) - Library(NumPy) module development

When you use ML or DL Frameworks(kind of TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn, Caffe, etc.), you may have experienced significantly long runtimes.

So, I improved the speed of the NumPy process responsible for computations in the Frameworks.

If you want to delve into the theoretical details, please check the 'mathematical_background_and_result_GMSF.pdf' file.

Enjoy.
